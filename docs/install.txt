Installing django-wall in a Pinax project
-----------------------------------------

Download Pinax from http://pinaxproject.com/download/

If you are using Pinax trunk, 'wall' should be listed in the
requirements/external_apps.txt file and is therefore installed
along with the other external apps. If you don't see wall there,
then add this line to external_apps.txt and rerun pip in the normal manner:
    
http://django-wall.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/

Installing the latest development version of django-wall
---------------------------------------------------------------
 
Check out or export the latest version of the application from subversion:
    
    svn co http://django-wall.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ django-wall



Install to be used in one Django project
-------------------------------------------    

Copy the inner ''wall'' app into your Django project. 
    
Install to be used in many Django projects
-------------------------------------------

Installing via symlink
-----------------------
 
Link the inner ``wall`` app to your Python path:
 
    sudo ln -s `pwd`/wall SITE_PACKAGES_DIR/wall
 
If you don't know the location of your site packages directory, this hack might do the trick for you:
 
    sudo ln -s `pwd`/wall `python -c "from distutils.sysconfig import get_python_lib; print get_python_lib()"`/wall
    
Now it's installed! Please see usage.txt for information on how to use this application in your projects.
 
Installing via setup.py
-----------------------
 
Included with this application is a file named ``setup.py``. It's possible to use this file to install this application to your system, by invoking the following command:
 
    sudo python setup.py install
 
Once that's done, you should be able to begin using django-wall at will.
 
Installing via setuptools
-------------------------
 
If you have setuptools_ installed, you can simply run the following command to install django-wall:
 
    sudo easy_install django-wall
